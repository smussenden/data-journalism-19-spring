# Data Journalism

This is the repo for Data Journalism, a course taught at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. This course was designed by professors Sean Mussenden and Adam Marton, building on the work of professors Dan Keating and Ira Chinoy, who previously taught this course.  

It is designed for use by students at the University of Maryland but anyone is free to work through the tutorials and exercises listed here.

## Course Syllabus

* **JOUR472/772 | Data Journalism (previously known as Computer-Assisted Reporting)**
* **Tuesday and Thursday, noon - 1:50 p.m.**
* **2103 Knight Hall**
* **Professor Sean Mussenden**
* **smussend@umd.edu | 202-590-2190 (call or text) | @seanm on Slack | @smussenden on Twitter | I'll do my best to respond quickly.**
* **Office hours and location | Monday 3-4:40, Thursday 3-4:30, other times by appointment. | During office hours, I'll usually be in 2206 Knight Hall.  Sometimes I may be at my desk in 3210 Knight Hall (Studio C). If you know you'll want to meet during office hours, it's best to message me ahead of time to reserve a slot, but you are free to drop by.**

### Objective

This is a practical, hands-on, skill-based course in the basics of data journalism, computer-assisted reporting and analysis. It is not a class in software. It is a journalism class that teaches students how to use tools and techniques to unearth key facts, patterns and proof in the service of storytelling.

### Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this course, we expect you to be able to:

* Use spreadsheets and database managers to “interview” data stored in electronic form. This includes using Microsoft Excel to sort, filter, write functions, build pivot tables and create simple charts.  It also includes using MySQL Workbench to work with relational databases to filter, sort, summarize and join tables. You will learn a systematic approach to finding patterns, promising leads and stories in a database to discover what no one has ever known before, documenting your work in a way that is reproducible and transparent. This approach includes data visualization techniques using open source and commonly available software tools and technology, and the methodical approach discussed in the Investigative Reporter's Handbook.   

* Understand how to obtain data from government agencies and other sources, by downloading information from public sites and through public information act requests to obtain data not available online.  

* Think about the limitations of a particular data set, work around those limitations and develop an understanding of what your data can and cannot show by using documentation and other sources.

* Understand how you might use the results of your data analysis as the foundation of or supplement to additional material in a news story (text, audio, video, graphics) and what additional work you'll need to do prior to publication.

* Understand the wider context of computer-assisted reporting, including its history, how it fits into the world of journalism, how it has been used in particular stories and projects, and the role that innovative thinking plays in the process.

* Understand how, despite advances in technology, the fundamentals of basic reporting still apply in data journalism. These include a devotion to accuracy, clarity, fairness, solid news value and, ultimately, good storytelling.

### Prerequisites

* **Graduate students in journalism:** Successful completion or current enrollment in JOUR 501, or equivalent professional experience.
* **Graduate students in other programs and special students:** Written permission or professional reporting experience.
* **Undergraduates:** Written permission of the professor.

### Required Texts and Materials

[The Investigative Reporter’s Handbook: A Guide to Documents, Databases and Techniques, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reporters-Handbook-Documents-Techniques/dp/0312589972), by Brant Houston and Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. (Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2008).  ISBN-13: 978-0-312-44265-1 or 978-0-3-1258997-4.

Additional readings from other sources will be required throughout the semester.  To comply with academic fair use regulations, they will be posted to the course website on the university's ELMS system, and will not be posted on this publicly available GitHub repo.

### Required Technology Resources

You should bring headphones to class every session, as some of our in-class labs require them.

All of the software you need to complete this course is available on computers in the labs at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. If you wish to work on your personal computer, you will find it useful to download the following programs. The tutorials were written using these specific software programs, so if you use a different version of the program, or a different operating system, your milage may vary.   

* Excel for Mac 2011, which is available for free for University of Maryland students at [TERPware](https://terpware.umd.edu/Mac/Title/1827). If you're not at the University of Maryland and want to follow along with this course, you'll be able to do many of the exercises using Google Sheets.
* MySQL Community server, available for free [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
* MySQL Workbench, available for free [here](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).
* Atom, a text editor available for free [here](https://atom.io/).
* GitHub Desktop, available for free [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

Note: I am much better at debugging problems with Macs than I am with PC.  I encourage you to use Macs for this class, if possible.

### Grading

* Exam 1 - 12.5%
* Exam 2 - 12.5%
* Data Acquisition Project - 20%
* Data Analysis Project - 20%

### Attendance and assignment deadlines

Because much of the learning in this course will be hands-on, it is important that you attend *every* class and show up on time. Showing up on time means you should be in your seat, your mobile device put away, logged in to a campus computer (or your own if you prefer) and ready to begin participating *before* class starts. Missing class or arriving late will affect your participation grade.

Unless I note otherwise, in-class labs are due at the end of class. You must be physically present in class to complete in-class lab assignments. If you are seriously ill and will miss class, let me know before class, by email or text. Unless you have my approval in advance, lab work cannot be made up. At my discretion, I may request a doctor's note before granting approval.

Unless I note otherwise, assigned homework is due by midnight prior to the next class session. As in, homework assigned at the end of class on Tuesday is due by midnight before class on Thursday.

Late assignments -- even one minute late -- will not be graded and given a zero. This includes all kinds of assignments, including major assignments.  Please take care to turn things in on time. Exceptions can be made on case-by-case basis in cases of serious illness or genuine emergency.

Unless I note otherwise, weather-based closures of the university do not change assignment deadlines.   

### Religious holidays

There will be no tests or major assignments scheduled on religious holidays identified by the university. If you expect to miss a class due to a religious holiday, please notify the instructor in writing before the start of the second class.

### Participation and demeanor

Though you will work hard in this class, I hope you will find it fun and rewarding. The give and take of classroom discussion is a great opportunity for all of us to learn.

At the start of class, you should silence your cell phone and put it in your bag.  You should not check it during class without asking permission.

The only program you should run on your computer during class is the one we are using at that time for class work.  

If you have been on the Web or checking e-mail at your seat before class starts, you must shut these programs down by the starting time for the class.

Using the computer or cell phone for messaging or browsing during class sessions results in a reduced grade in class participation, which accounts for 5 percent of the overall course grade. If your demeanor interrupts or interferes with the class, your participation grade will suffer.

The College of Journalism does not permit food or beverages in the lab.

### Academic integrity

Along with certain rights, students have the responsibility to behave honorably in an academic environment. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty and plagiarism, will not be tolerated. Adhering to a high ethical standard is of special importance in journalism, where reliability and credibility are the cornerstones of the field. Therefore, the college has adopted a “zero tolerance” policy on academic dishonesty. Any abridgment of academic integrity standards in a College of Journalism course will be referred to the university’s Student Honor Council and the college's deans. To insure this is understood, all students are asked to sign an academic integrity pledge at the beginning of the semester that will cover all assignments in this course. Students found to have violated the university's honor code may face sanctions, including a grade of XF for the course.

### Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities requiring special accommodation during the semester should make an appointment to meet with the instructor as soon as possible.

### Course evaluations

The university administration asks students to complete course evaluations through the CourseEvalUM website at http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu/. This system is anonymous and will be open for your input toward the end of the semester. The evaluations are a useful element in curriculum development.

### Students in Need of Assistance

The University of Maryland offers a variety of services for students in need of either educational or psychological assistance. Learning Assistance Service (LAS) offers services and programs on writing skills, English as a second language, study and time management skills, math learning skills, and issues for students over 25 years of age. The service also offers a range of handouts, available online. If you need other educational services or support, please contact your instructor for additional resources.

If you are experiencing personal stress that is interfering with your ability to succeed, please consider contacting the Counseling Center or the Mental Health Service at the University Health Center for an appointment. The Counseling Center also offers online resources on a series of topics.
