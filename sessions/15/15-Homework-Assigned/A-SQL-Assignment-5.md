# Class 15 Homework
## SQL Assignment 5 | Exam Prep

### Goal of Today's Homework

The goal of today's homework is to use all of your SQL skills to provide the foundation for an enterprise story, on the role of alcohol in boating accidents.

In this lab we'll again be using a multi-table database of boating accidents collected by the Coast Guard. Documentation is [bard_record_layout.xlsx](bard_record_layout.xlsx).

You are free to use all four tables in this database. In addition to Accidents and Deaths, use the Injuries table, which describes people injured in accidents, and Vessels, which describes the watercraft involved in the accidents.

### The Scenario

Following on the data story you produced about the Memorial Day jet ski accident, your editor assigns you to produce a piece about the role of alcohol in boating accidents that lead to people getting injured or killed.  As part of this story, you will examine the state of Maryland's effort to get people to stop drinking and boating.

As you begin reporting out this story, you sit down to do an analysis of the boating accident data to understand how alcohol plays a role in these accidents. Your goal is to produce a memo of seven of the most newsworthy, interesting things you can find on this subject.

### The Details

You'll submit a sql file with your findings, written as though you could drop them into a news story.  Below each finding, include your SQL query that discovered the finding.

You'll likely have other queries you've typed out to help you arrive at your findings. Don't delete these!  In your queries, you must do/use each of these at least one time:

* SELECT
* FROM
* ORDER BY
* LIKE with a wildcard
* GROUP BY
* AS
* COUNT, AVERAGE, SUM, MIN and MAX
* JOIN
* HAVING
* WITH ROLLUP
