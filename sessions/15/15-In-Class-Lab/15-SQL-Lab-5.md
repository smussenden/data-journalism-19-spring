# Class 15 In Class Lab
## SQL Lesson 5 | Exam Prep, Putting it altogether

### Goal of Today's Lab

The goal of today's lab is to use all of your SQL skills to provide context to a developing news story.

In this lab we'll again be using a multi-table database of boating accidents collected by the Coast Guard. Documentation is [bard_record_layout.xlsx](bard_record_layout.xlsx).  

Unlike previous assignments, you are free to use four tables in this database. In addition to Accidents and Deaths, use the Injuries table, which describes people injured in accidents, and Vessels, which describes the watercraft involved in the accidents. Do not use any of the other tables.

You will work with a partner on this assignment. You will submit one file of findings and queries.

### The Scenario

It's Memorial Day weekend in 2017. You're the Saturday cops reporter at the Baltimore Sun, and you get a call from a source in Ocean City that there's been a horrific jet ski accident in the Atlantic Ocean near Ocean City. You call the Ocean City cops and confirm that three people were killed when two jet skis collided in the Atlantic Ocean, just off of Ocean City.  

The details: A 19-year-old boy, who had a blood alcohol content of .12, and his 13-year-old sister were on one jet ski. A 45-year-old man was on the other one.  Both jet skis were Sea Doo brand, which were rented from a local shop, and both drivers had both never driven a jet ski prior to today, according to police interviews with their family.

You quickly write up the developing story and post it in the CMS for editor review.  Your editor assigns your colleague to make calls looking for friends and relatives of the deceased, while she assigns a stringer in Ocean City to go look for witnesses and shoot photos.  She knows you learned how to use the Coast Guard boating accidents database in a course at the University of Maryland, so she asks you to "find me anything you can that helps put this horrible accident in context."  

She gives you have an hour and a half to update the story.  You resolve yourself to find the five most interesting bits of information to add to the story to provide the context she requires.  Questions race through your mind: how common are accidents with kids, as with this one? Are inexperienced boaters more likely to die? How risky are these personal watercraft anyway?  

What else do you want to know?

NOTE: For the purpose of this assignment, the data is complete through the end of 2016.

### The Details

You'll submit a sql file with your findings, written as though you could drop them into a news story.  Below each finding, include your SQL query that discovered the finding.

You'll likely have other queries you've typed out to help you arrive at your findings. Don't delete these!  In your queries, you must do/use each of these at least one time:

* SELECT
* FROM
* ORDER BY
* LIKE with a wildcard
* GROUP BY
* AS
* COUNT, AVERAGE, SUM, MIN and MAX
* JOIN
* HAVING
* WITH ROLLUP
