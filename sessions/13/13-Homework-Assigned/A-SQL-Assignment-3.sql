# 1. Write a query to return a table that lists one record per death where alcohol or drug use was listed as a cause of the accident. How many such deaths were there?

# 2. What day of the week has the lowest average age of people killed in accidents?

# 3: What percentage of people killed on the Potomac River were wearing life jackets?

# 4: You're writing a story about the role alcohol plays in boating accidents and are looking for a detail for a story. A Coast Guard source tells you he remembered an accident that caused thousands of dollars in damage after the occupants downed more than a dozen small tubs of beer (an average one of these containers holds about 6 bottles of beer) at a bar before hitting the water some time in the last decade.  You try to find it in the data. How many of these tubs did they pay for?

# 5: How many accidents were there where at least one person who wasn't the operator of a boat (an occupant) died?

# 6 - #8 Think of three interesting questions to ask and answer of the data.  At least two of them should join accidents to the death table.
