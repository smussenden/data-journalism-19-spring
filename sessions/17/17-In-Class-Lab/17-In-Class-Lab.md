# Class 17 In Class Lab
## Data Analysis Lab 1 - Documentation Lab
### Goal of Today's Lab

The goal of today's lab is to get you started on your data analysis assignment, by reviewing the documentation for the FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) database, to get a sense of what information it contains.

Using the documentation links provided below, work with a partner to develop an understanding of:

* the type of information about fatal auto accidents is stored in each table.
* the common fields that will allow you to join individual tables together.
* the fields in each table that might allow you to ask interesting questions to understand something about fatal auto accidents.  

Note: in some cases, the information provided in the documentation and our version of the database may not perfectly match. This is common, and something for you to work around.     

### Instructions

Create a new SQL script file. You should work with a partner in class, but each person should create their own file.

1. Write a SELECT query for each table in the database. Find information about that table and the fields by searching through the documentation. A good place to start is the NICAR guide to FARS. You may find it useful to Command+F for field and table names in the FARS User Manual. In an SQL comment, write a sentence explaining what kind of information this table stores.  

2. After completing this, think of 3-5 potential questions you could ask of this database -- or general topic areas you could explore.  List those questions or topics and list the specific tables and fields you would want to examine to explore those questions/topics. To help you with this, you may find it useful to examine the NICAR Tipsheets and stories for inspiration.

3. Using Google, Lexis-Nexis or other search tool, find two news stories that made use of the FARS database. Write two to three sentences for each story with your best guess at some of the fields and tables they used to do their analysis. Paste the text of the stories at the bottom of your SQL file, along with the publication/news org name, and the date.    

You will likely not finish this in class.  If you don't finish it, submit it as homework.
