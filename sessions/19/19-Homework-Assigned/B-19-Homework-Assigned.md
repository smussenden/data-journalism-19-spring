# Class 19 Homework
## Data Cleaning Practice

### Goal of Today's Homework

This homework is designed to give you additional practice with data cleaning using the Open Refine tool, building on today's lab tutorials. A very common problem, which was identified in the Quartz Guide to Bad Data, is inconsistent value names that make it difficult to calculate summary statistics.  This tutorial will give you practice with that.

### How to Submit

Export your edited spreadsheet from OpenRefine and upload it to [this ELMS assignment](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1259604/assignments/4812003?module_item_id=9445319).

### The Data

For this lab, we'll be working with a small slice of the "vessel" table from the BARD boating accidents database we've worked with previously in class. Download it [here](vessels.xlsx).

### The Task

There are myriad inconsistencies in the Manufacturer, Model and EngineManufacturer columns that would make it difficult to calculate grouping summary statistics.  Let's fix this.  Using text facets and different clustering methods, do your best to fix these problems.

At a minimum, you should clean up Manufacturer and EngineManufacturer. If you want more of a challenge, optionally try cleaning up Model.
