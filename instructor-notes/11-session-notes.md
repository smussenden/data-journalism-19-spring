* You are going to paste your PIA request letter into the forum as a post, along with your contact log. When you send it, after I approve, you'll put on letterhead.
* Do not send it before I explicitly approve.
* Use the sample letter as a guide.  
  * Paragraph 1: Write to the person you've been dealing with or the PIA custodian. Refer to your conversations or correspondence.
  * Paragraph 1 and 2: Be specific about what you're asking for.  Include the name, if you know it, and as much detail as you have about it.  This includes field names and the kind of information in the database, but note that request not limited to those fields. Be specific about the time period. Be clear that you're asking for electronic records.
  * Paragraph 3: Ask for documentation.
  * Paragraph 4: Be clear about electronic data you're looking for.  You'll take pretty much anything, as long as it's electronic.  
  * Paragraph 5 and 7: I understand you may have to redact, but there may be some judgment calls. I hope you'll decide in favor of giving me the access. But if you deny me, site the exemptions, and note that you still have to give me the non exempt parts.
  * Paragraph 6: I am making this for CNS. Do NOT say you are a student.
  * Paragraph 8: Please give it to me for free because this is in the public interest. But don't do anything that costs money without my prior approval.
