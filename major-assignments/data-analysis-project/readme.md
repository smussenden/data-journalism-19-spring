# Data Analysis Project

This project will give you a chance to go through the process of analyzing a complex database on your own in order to discover newsworthy information.  

You will be provided with a database to analyze for this project, a slice of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's fatal auto accidents reporting system, FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) from 2010 to 2016 for Maryland, Delaware and Washington, D.C.

**With instructor permission only**, you may use database or collection of spreadsheets of sufficient complexity instead of the database provided to you. Please see me if you have an idea for a project you'd like to work on.  

## Deliverables and Schedule

**Session 17:** the project will be introduced in detail.

**Session 19:** 500 word status memo posted as a forum post is due informing me of the following.

* the questions you hope to answer with the database.
* why this would be of interest to an audience of readers, viewers or listeners.
* what you have discovered in your initial analysis, and what you plan to do to complete the assignment.

You should also paste at the bottom well-commented SQL with at least five queries you have written as you begin to explore the data.

**Session 23:** a 250 word status memo as a forum post is due as a forum post, updating me on your progress. If your project has evolved to answer new questions, you should inform me of that at this time. Otherwise, indicate what new information you have discovered.  You should attach your updated, well-commented SQL file with at least 10 additional queries as you explore the database.

**Session 29:** The final deliverables for this project are due.  

***Story Memo***
You will turn in a story memo of 1,000 to 1,200 words (about five pages, double-spaced).

This story memo should pitch a story idea derived primarily from your analysis of the database, including a discussion of what you found that was newsworthy when you analyzed the data, how the data could be used to develop the story, and what additional steps would be needed to complete the reporting of this story.  

The story memo should be written as if you were trying to get the attention of a very busy editor and convince that editor to give you the opportunity to pursue a story you believe is suggested by your analysis.

The final story memo should include the following:

* A strong statement at the top.  Write this as if I am your editor and you are competing for my attention with reporters pitching other story ideas.  That is, don’t start by saying, “I sat down and launched mysql and looked at the database and sorted it 10 different ways.” Tell me right up front what you found that was interesting or what you found that suggests a dynamite story.  Tell me how your most newsworthy findings relate to what you found in your research about prior uses of similar data for stories elsewhere. Do not pitch your findings for more than they are worth, however, or make assertions not supported by your work.
* A summary of the results of your analysis. Describe results that are germane to the main thrust of the story you are pitching and, if appropriate, relevant results that suggest other interesting avenues to explore.  You may want to include graphics, tables or charts that will make it easier for me to grasp what you are trying to communicate. Indicate whether your findings are new or whether they present a local angle for similar findings reported elsewhere.
* Pros and cons of the data. Discuss both the strengths and limitations of the data.
* How you would verify your findings. Identify the specific reporting and data steps would you take and the types of information you would use to determine whether the results of your analysis are accurate and significant.  If your analysis suggests fault or issues of accountability on the part of public or private figures, indicate whom you would need to contact for response to ensure that your reporting was fair and accurate.
* Bringing it home. Indicate the specific steps you would need to take to finish reporting the story.  Include the people you would contact and, if relevant, the places you would visit. Indicate how you would make the story real to readers. Construct a narrative example from one case based on as much information as you can draw from all of the tables that pertain to that case.
* Editors are not interested in process. Don’t fill the memo with what steps you took.

***SQL File Discovery log***

You should turn in a well-commented SQL file that included the queries you wrote in support of your story memo. It should include at least 15 queries germane to your story memo. It should include both the questions, queries and answers you developed in support of your final story memo.

***Research Information***

Append copies of one or two news stories, government reports or other information you found in support of your story memo.

## Words of Advice

* Keep a project log of your all your work on this assignment. This sort of audit trail would enable you to recreate and confirm your findings if you were working on a project in a newsroom. You can select parts of this log for the “discovery log” you will submit with this assignment.

* Steady work on this project will be better than trying to do it all in a rush at the end.

* Use the IRE Resource Center, Lexis-Nexis and other databases to find stories or even academic research related to your topic. This database has been frequently used by journalists to develop stories, and you may find past work helpful in developing a new angle for this assignments.

* If you are an IRE member, you can check to see if IRE has tip sheets or Uplink articles on the data you are using. This will help you determine if there are established caveats and opportunities related to the database.
